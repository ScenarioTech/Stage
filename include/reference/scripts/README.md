## include/reference/scripts: Access Points to Script Resources

<!-- /TITLE -->

The scripts in this directory are meant to be included from the src/ directory by stage builders who want easy access to common feature sets.

### medium/

Contains classes and tools used to build the stage medium -- that is, the set of expressions that make up a stage. A medium-builder class typically includes some common expression preprocessing tools as well as functions that the stage builder can use to load and implement the unique parts of a stage alongside the standard components.
